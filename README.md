Explanation:
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying grayscale images of handwritten math symbols into one of 82 possible classes. The steps taken include:

Data Preprocessing:

Reading images from the dataset.
Resizing and normalizing them.
Label encoding for categorical output.

Model Building:

A CNN architecture using layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense.
ReLU activation for hidden layers and Softmax for multi-class output.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Trained over 10 epochs using the Adam optimizer.
Evaluation done using accuracy and loss metrics.
Confusion matrix plotted to visualize performance across classes.

Results:
Achieved a reasonable accuracy considering the complexity and number of classes.
Observed common misclassifications between visually similar symbols.
